# Code Refactor - Horison

With the advancement of digital tools, it's important to remember to optimize websites for accessibility. Screen readers perform better when headings appear in order on the page, and low-sight/no-sight individuals understand what's on a page more with descriptive alt tags for images and the use of semantic elements within code.

# Description

Starter code for this was site cloned from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.

I looked at the code and gave the page a title that is descriptive for SEO and within the character limits. I changed out mutliple uses of <div> to more descriptive semantic HTML elements while being sure not to break how the code performed in a live enviroment. H1, H2, and H3 tags appeared in that order through the code. Descriptive alt tags were added to icons and images.

The CSS file was edited with the addition of comments and reformatted for better navigation. Styles sections were put in the correct order under the comments.

# Deployment
